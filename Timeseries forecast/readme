This project focuses on forecasting hourly electricity demand to help energy providers and grid operators optimize resource allocation and reduce operational costs.

## Overview
- Developed and trained machine learning models using historical consumption data.
- Provided accurate demand forecasts to support efficient energy distribution.
- Helped minimize operational costs by optimizing grid resource allocation.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering from time-series datasets.
- Forecasting models: ARIMA, Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- Model evaluation with RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
## Dataset
The dataset includes historical hourly electricity consumption data.
