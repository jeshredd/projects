This project analyzes patient drug reviews to identify and classify medical conditions, helping healthcare providers understand patient experiences and feedback more effectively.

- Applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to preprocess patient reviews.
- Implemented **machine learning models** for condition classification.
- Delivered insights to improve patient feedback analysis and support better healthcare decision-making.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.)
- Machine learning classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of patient drug reviews with associated conditions and ratings.
